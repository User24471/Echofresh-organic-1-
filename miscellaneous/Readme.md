Notes

- Replace placeholder images (`farm.jpg`, `fruits.jpg`, etc.) with your own images.  
- Update the **Google Maps embed link** in `contact.html` with your location.  
- The form in `contact.html` is static — to make it functional, you’ll need backend code (PHP, Node.js, etc.) or a form service.
